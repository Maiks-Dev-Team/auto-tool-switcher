# Reference Files

This directory contains files that were part of the original Auto Tool Switcher project but are not actively used in the current implementation. They are kept here for reference purposes in case they contain useful code or concepts that might be needed in the future.

## Contents

### Root Directory Files

- `main.js` - Original Electron implementation with more detailed UI interactions
- `simple-mcp-server.js` - A simplified MCP server implementation
- `test-mcp-connection.js` - Test script for MCP connections
- `test.json` - Test configuration file
- `mcp_config_example.json` - Example MCP configuration file

### Source Files (`src/`)

- `mcp-index.js` - Original MCP index implementation
- `mcp-stdio.js` - MCP stdio transport implementation
- `mcpApi.js` - Original MCP API implementation
- `mcpApiFull.js` - Full MCP API implementation with additional features

## Usage

These files are kept for reference only and are not actively used in the current implementation. If you need to reference any functionality from these files, you can copy the relevant code back to the active codebase.

## Notes

- Some of these files may contain outdated or deprecated code
- They might not be compatible with the current modular architecture
- Use with caution and test thoroughly if incorporating any code from these files
